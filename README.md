[From Stored Data to Data Stories](https://github.com/pjkowalczyk/DataPhilly_StoredDataStories). 
- Instructor: [Paul Kowalzyck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauljkowalczyk/). 
- Detail: This workshop will take one through the steps associated with an end-to-end machine learning campaign: data retrieval; data curation; model construction, evaluation, selection and interpretation; and reporting. Particular attention will be paid to reporting, i.e., building a narrative. Examples will be presented demonstrating how one might generate multiple output formats (e.g., HTML pages, presentation slides, PDF documents) starting with the same code base.
