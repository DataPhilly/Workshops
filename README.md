### September 2020
[From Stored Data to Data Stories](https://github.com/pjkowalczyk/DataPhilly_StoredDataStories). 
- Instructor: [Paul Kowalzyck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauljkowalczyk/). 
- Detail: This workshop will take one through the steps associated with an end-to-end machine learning campaign: data retrieval; data curation; model construction, evaluation, selection and interpretation; and reporting. Particular attention will be paid to reporting, i.e., building a narrative. Examples will be presented demonstrating how one might generate multiple output formats (e.g., HTML pages, presentation slides, PDF documents) starting with the same code base.

### October 2020
[Intro to SQL](http://tpcg.io/HjSt3dp7). 
- Instructor: [Kayleigh Smoot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayleigh-smoot/). 
- Detail: SQL is the back-end language for direct data manipulation for many major websites, databases, and computer systems around the world. This workshop is intended to give you a clear understanding of basic SQL syntax and concepts. 
- Interactive Workshop Examples: [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/2QC)

### November 2020
**Tidyverse: How R should be used**. 
- Instructor: [Zane Murphy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zane-murphy-406809125/). 
- Detail: R has been rapidly growing as one of the most widely used programming languages for data science in recent years. However, in its most basic form, R is complicated, a bit choppy, and generally doesnâ€™t provide much benefit over its main competitor, Python. Enter Tidyverse, a collection of packages maintained by the R foundation for reading, cleaning, processing, modeling, and visualizing data. In this workshop, we will learn the best practices for coding in the Tidyverse and will come to understand why it is giving Pandas a run for its money. We will cover everything from installing and configuring the latest versions of R and the Tidyverse to building a model on sample data and visualizing the results in a markdown document.
- Workshop files can be found [here](https://github.com/zanemurphy/DataPhilly-Tidyverse) or [here](https://github.com/zanemurphy/DataPhilly-Tidyverse). 
  - The files include details on software and packages to be downloaded (WorkshopInfo.pdf), cheat sheets,  and .rmd file (parking_violations_nb.Rmd) used in the workshop.
  
### December 2020

### January 2021 
**Satellit Imagery Analysis with Python**
- Instructor: [Simon Kassel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-kassel-6b074434/).  
- Detail: Participants will learn the basics of working with geospatial data in Python. They will learn how to generate basic analytics using both vector (e.g. points, lines, and polygons) and raster (e.g. satellite imagery) datasets. The workshop will also discuss how to prepare imagery and labels for training machine learning models. Throughout the process of the workshop, attendees will be introduced to indispensable open-source geospatial libraries like GDAL, Rasterio, GeoPandas, and Shapely.
